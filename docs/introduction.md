ServiceToken is a pre-purchased claim on someone's unit of time represented as an Ethereum ECR20 token specification compliant smart contract. It is inspired by Forrester's Service Units (SU) concept. SUs are prepaid units that may be used by a client to access various analyst interactions and other services from Forrester.

Let's say that a Forrester client expects to need to talk to an analyst four times in year, but is not exactly sure when that will be. Whilst they could draw up a separate contract for each session, getting budget approval, drawing up contracts, purchase orders and paying is an tedious and expensive process. Often it is easier to pre-buy time in the form of SUs at the beginning of the year and draw down on them as an when needed. This type of arrangement is often called a retainer agreement, and SUs are a way to account for time.

One of the issues that SUs face, is that since there is no independent central authority to track the authoritative count of issued and redeemed SUs, both parties have to track the SU ledger and reconcile on periodic basis. Whenever there is a failure to reconcile, a potentially relationship damaging dispute occurs. By tracking SUs as FlexiTime tokens on blockchain, you gain a shared, autonomous ledger that both parties can trust, yet not have to constantly reconcile.
