ServiceToken is a pre-purchased claim on someone's unit of time represented as an Ethereum ECR20 token specification compliant smart contract. It is inspired by Forrester's Service Units (SU) concept. SUs are prepaid units that may be used by a client to access various analyst interactions and other services from Forrester.
